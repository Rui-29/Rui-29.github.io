* I am a research student at [ICON lab](https://intelconstructlab.github.io/index.html) in the [Department of Civil Engineering](https://civil.ubc.ca/), [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/).
* My current research interests are leveraging machine learning techniques to achieve intelligent building operation and construction. For operation, I care about demand-responsive control, building energy efficiency, and indoor environment quality. In terms of construction, I explore the application of reinforcement learning controlled construction robots.
